**My meetup experience**

The meetup attended helps me to realize that I should talk the data science talk and practice a lot. With my springboard projects
I have been doing that for the last several months. 
	The meetup I attended focuses on theoretical problems followed by practice problems using R and python programming languages. 
The participants presented different practical examples from their respective professions. 
	I have introduced myself to the instructor and asked her if she can put me in one of the groups in the meetup, which she did. 
I plan to attend several related meetups in the coming weeks and try to network more. I believe the best way to get a job is through networking. I hope attending these meetups allow me to network with professionals who can help me get my resume to the right people. 
I believe people love helping others, so I try to reach out to friends and connections to get my resume in the right hands.
	Finally, the meetup has a presentation format which I believe help me develop my confidence in presenting myself.
I have failed significantly more times in my career history than I have succeeded. I made many mistakes, but I made sure
I learned from them and kept moving forward. For this career transition, I plan to apply to numerous jobs.
I expect to get numerous interviews and rejections.
